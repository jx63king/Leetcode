# 1. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/


Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Example:

## Example 1: 
`Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,`

`Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,`

`return [0, 1].`

## Example 2: 
`Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`

`Output: [1,2]`

## Example 3: 
`Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6`

`Output: [0,1]`




### My Thought: 
have a list with key 
try to find the remaining number in the rest of the list


### Code: 


```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        checked = {}
        for k, num in enumerate(nums):
            if(target - num) in checked: 
                return [checked[target - num], k]
            checked[num] = k 
        

```
